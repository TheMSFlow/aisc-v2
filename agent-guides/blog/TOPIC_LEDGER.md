# The Awakening — Topic Ledger
> Read `agent-guides/blog/BLOG_BRIEF.md` first.
> This is the single source of truth for what has been written, what is reserved, and how briefings link to each other. **No briefing gets drafted without a row here first.** The ledger exists to prevent the two failure modes that kill blogs at scale: duplicate topics and orphaned posts.

---

## Rules

1. **Reserve before writing.** Before drafting, add a row to the Pipeline table with the primary query and angle. If the primary query overlaps an existing row (published or reserved), stop: strengthen the existing piece or find a genuinely different query. Two briefings must never target the same primary query.
2. **Confirm at publish.** When a post ships (`draft: false`), move its row from Pipeline to Published and fill every column.
3. **The link graph is derived, never hand-maintained.** Run `node scripts/blog-links-report.mjs` to see actual internal links, inbound counts, and orphans; `--write` refreshes the generated section at the bottom of this file. Do not edit that section by hand.
4. **Primary query = the search a specific leader types.** Not a keyword soup. "AI policy for churches" is a primary query; "AI faith leadership" is not.
5. **Demand check at brief time.** Before reserving, spend five minutes validating the query family exists: web search the phrasing, check autocomplete variants, check the SERP for what currently ranks and whether the AISC seat-angle beats it. Note the strongest variant in the row.

## Linking Strategy (hub and spoke)

The category pages are the hubs; briefings are the spokes. Google ranks hubs that spokes point into, and spokes that hubs legitimize.

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Sibling links | Every briefing links to **2+ sibling briefings** in-body, on natural anchor text |
| Reciprocity | When post B links to post A, check whether A should link back on the next refresh. Aim for pairs, not one-way chains |
| Orphan rule | **No briefing with zero inbound links.** The links report flags orphans; fixing them is part of publishing the next post (every new post should link to at least one under-linked sibling, not just the popular ones) |
| Hub anchors | Taxonomy chips and breadcrumbs handle hub linking automatically; in-body links to category pages are welcome where they read naturally |
| Anchor text | Descriptive of the destination ("the governance briefing"), never "click here" or a bare URL |
| Depth | Every briefing reachable within 2 clicks of `/awakening` (hub → category → post). Currently guaranteed by the taxonomy pages |
