    accent:

    body: "Fluency is knowing how to work with AI as a leader. That means directing it, delegating to it, and knowing where it does not belong. The first thing fluency returns to a leader is time: real hours, on paper, that were being lost to work AI can handle. Most leaders find the number larger than they expected.",

This challenge gives you the framework to identify which of those problems is yours to lead, or which new opportunity AI has made possible that no one has discovered yet. You leave with this discovery and a roadmap to help you get there.",
